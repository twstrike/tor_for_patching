  o Minor features (compilation):
    - Note our minimum required autoconf/automake versions in the
      appropriate locations. Closes ticket 17732.

  o Dependency updates:
    - Tor now uses Autoconf version 2.63 or later, and Automake 1.11 or later
      (released in 2008 and 2009 respectively).  If you are building Tor from
      the git repository instead of from the source distribution, and your
      tools are older than this, you will need to upgrade.
      Closes ticket 17732.

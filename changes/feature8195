  o Major features:
    - When Tor is started as root on Linux and told to switch user ID, it
      can now retain the capabilitity to bind to low ports.  By default,
      Tor will do this only when it's switching user ID and some low
      ports have been configured.  You can change this behavior with
      the new option KeepBindCapabilities.  Closes ticket 8195.

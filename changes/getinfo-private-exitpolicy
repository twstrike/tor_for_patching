  o Minor features (exit policies, controllers):
    - Add controller getinfo exit-policy/reject-private/[default,relay]
      for the reject rules added by ExitPolicyRejectPrivate. This makes
      it easier for stem to display exit policies.
    - Add unit tests for getinfo exit-policy/*.
      Completes ticket #17183. Patch by "teor".

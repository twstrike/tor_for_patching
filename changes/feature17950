  o Minor features:
    - Add a family argument to get_interface_addresses_raw() and
      subfunctions to make network interface address interogation more
      efficient. Now Tor can specifically ask for IPv4, IPv6 or both
      types of interfaces from the operating system. Resolves ticket 17950.

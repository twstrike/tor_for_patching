  o Minor features (security):
    - Never use the system entropy output directly for anything besides
      seeding the PRNG.  When we want to generate important keys, instead
      of using system entropy directly, hash it with the PRNG stream.
      This may help resist certain attacks based on broken OS entropy
      implementations. Closes part of ticket 17694.

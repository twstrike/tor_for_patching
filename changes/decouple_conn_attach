  o Code simplification and refactorings:
    - Decouple the list of streams needing to be attached to circuits
      from the overall connection list. This change makes it possible to
      attach streams quickly while both simplifying Tor's callgraph and
      avoiding O(N) scans of the entire connection list.  Closes ticket
      17590.

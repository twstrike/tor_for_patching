  o Removed features:
    - Remove client-side support for connecting to Tor servers running
      versions of Tor before 0.2.3.6-alpha. These servers didn't
      support the v3 TLS handshake protocol, and are no longer allowed
      on the Tor network.  Implements the client side of ticket
      11150. Based on patches by Tom van der Woerdt.

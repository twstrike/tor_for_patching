  o Minor bugfixes (logging):
    - In log messages that include a function name, use __FUNCTION__ instead
      of __PRETTY_FUNCTION__.  In GCC, these are synonymous, but with clang
      __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ has extra information we don't need.
      Fixes bug 16563; bugfix on 0.0.2pre8. Fix by Tom van der Woerdt.

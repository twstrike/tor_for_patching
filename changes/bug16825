  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Count receipt of new microdescriptors as progress towards
      bootstrapping. Now, when a user who has set EntryNodes finishes
      bootstrapping, Tor automatically repopulates the guard set based
      on this new directory information. Fixes bug 16825; bugfix on
      0.2.3.1-alpha.

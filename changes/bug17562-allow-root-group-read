  o Minor bug fixes:
    - If any directory created by Tor is marked as group readable, the
      filesystem group is allowed to be either the default GID or the root
      user. Allowing root to read the DataDirectory prevents the need for
      CAP_READ_SEARCH when using systemd's CapabilityBoundingSet, or
      dac_read_search when using SELinux.

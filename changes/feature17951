  o Minor features:
    - When get_interface_address6_list(.,AF_UNSPEC,.) is called and fails
      to enumerate interface addresses using the platform-specific API,
      have it rely on the UDP socket fallback technique to try and find
      out what IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) our machine has. Resolves
      ticket 17951.

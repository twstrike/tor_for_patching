  o Minor bugfixes (linux seccomp2 sandbox):
    - Avoid a 10-second delay when starting as a client with "Sandbox 1"
      enabled and no DNS resolvers configured.  This should help TAILS
      start up faster. Fixes bug 18548; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.


  o Minor features (linux seccomp2 sandbox):
    - Detect and reject attempts to change our Address with "Sandbox 1"
      enabled. Changing Address with Sandbox turned on would never
      actually work, but previously it would fail in strange and
      confusing ways.  Found while fixing 18548.

  o Code simplificiation and refactoring:
    - When a direct directory request fails immediately on launch,
      instead of relaunching that request from inside the code that
      launches it, instead mark the connection for teardown. This
      change simplifies Tor's callback and prevents the directory-
      request launching code from invoking itself recursively.
      Closes ticket 17589.

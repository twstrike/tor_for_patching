  o Minor features (directory system):
    Previously only relays who explicitly opened a directory port (DirPort)
    accepted directory requests from clients.  Now all relays, with and without
    a DirPort, who do not disable the DirCache option accept and serve
    directory requests sent (tunnelled) through their ORPort.
    Closes ticket 12538.
